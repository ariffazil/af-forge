## 📜 I. THE SEVEN AXIOMS (Λ)

1.  **Λ1 — Identity Precedes Action:** No tool executes before the session is anchored and the actor is identified.
2.  **Λ2 — Reality Before Simulation:** All projections must ground in sensed, authoritative physical data.
3.  **Λ3 — Risk Before Reward:** Entropy analysis and adversarial critique MUST precede capital allocation.
4.  **Λ4 — Judgment Before Execution:** No irreversible act (Tier 05) without a constitutional SEAL (Tier 00).
5.  **Λ5 — Orthogonality Preservation:** Physics (GEOX) and Wealth (WEALTH) must remain independent until the Judgment Gate.
6.  **Λ6 — Vault Closure:** Every executed action must close into the Vault record for temporal continuity.
7.  **Λ7 — Metabolism Continuity:** The system monitor (autonomic nervous system) cannot be disabled.

## 🗂 II. THE 99-TOOL COGNITIVE STACK

Tools are ordered by **Cognitive Layer**, not by department.

| Tier | Name | Tools | Cognitive Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **00** | **Identity** | 01–15 | **Self-Model:** Who am I? What are my floors? |
| **01** | **Perception** | 16–30 | **Sensing:** What is the state of the world? |
| **02** | **Physics** | 31–45 | **GEOX:** How do the laws of the Earth apply? |
| **03** | **Economics** | 46–60 | **WEALTH:** How is capital/energy distributed? |
| **04** | **Risk** | 61–70 | **Heart/Bias:** What are the costs of error? |
| **05** | **Execution** | 71–80 | **Forge:** Controlled real-world action. |
| **06** | **Stewardship** | 81–89 | **Civilization:** What are the long-term impacts? |
| **07** | **Reflection** | 90–99 | **Mind:** Metacognition and task-graph planning. |

## 📐 V. MATHEMATICAL FORMALIZATION (Ω & METABOLISM)

### 1. Ωₒᵣₜₕₒ Score (Normalized Orthogonality)
To prevent "hallucinatory convergence" or economic bias in physical modeling, $\Omega_{ortho}$ is a normalized score computed from cross-domain correlation:

**Ωₒᵣₜₕₒ = 1 − mean(|ρᵢⱼ|)** for all $i \neq j$ cross-domain pairs.
- **ρᵢⱼ:** Pearson correlation between output vectors of domain lanes $i$ and $j$ (Physics, Wealth, Governance).
- **Lₚ (Physics Lane):** Log-likelihood of physical evidence (GEOX).
- **Lw (Wealth Lane):** Economic NPV/EMV projections (WEALTH).
- **L_g (Governance Lane):** Constitutional floor compliance (arifOS).

### 2. ΔS (Entropy Delta / Metabolic Cost)
Based on Landauer’s Principle:
**ΔS = Σ (k_B * ln(2) * bits_erased) + κᵣ * J**
- **bits_erased:** Information lost during state transition.
- **κᵣ (Reversibility):** Coefficient (0-1). 1.0 is fully reversible (CODE), 0.1 is irreversible physical action.
- **J:** Thermodynamic energy (Joules) consumed by computation/execution.

### 3. Peace² (Stability Metric)
**Peace² = (Maruah × κᵣ) × sign(NPV)**
- **Maruah (F6):** Dignity/Ethical score (0-1).
- **κᵣ:** Reversibility.
- **sign(NPV):** 1 if value-positive, -1 if value-destructive.

### 📊 4. NUMERICAL THRESHOLDS (SEAL/HOLD/VOID)

| Metric | SEAL (Proceed) | HOLD (Caution) | VOID (Halt) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ωₒᵣₜₕₒ** | ≥ 0.95 | 0.85 – 0.95 | < 0.85 |
| **ΔS (Norm)** | < 0.20 | 0.20 – 0.50 | > 0.50 |
| **Peace²** | > 0.70 | 0.40 – 0.70 | < 0.40 |
| **κᵣ (Phys)** | > 0.40 | 0.10 – 0.40 | < 0.10 |

## 📜 AMENDMENTS
- **AMENDMENT 001:** Formalized Ωₒᵣₜₕₒ as a normalized correlation inverse (1 - mean|ρ|). Established computable SEAL/HOLD/VOID thresholds for all metabolic metrics.
- **AMENDMENT 002:** Objective Function Calibration Floor. The Objective Function (OF) must never return < 0.10 when NPV > 0, EMV > 0, Ωₒᵣₜₕₒ ≥ 0.95, and ΔS < 0.20. Under these conditions, an OF < 0.10 triggers `CONSTITUTION_DIAGNOSTIC` mode and an "OF_CALIBRATION_ANOMALY" log, escalating to the Architect.
- **AMENDMENT 003:** Temporal Anchoring Requirement. Any tool call in Tier 01 that ingests legal, regulatory, or procedural data MUST include the precise procedural stage, exact date of the most recent action, and a call to `geox_time4d_verify_timing` to prevent ΔS inflation from interpretive temporal framing.
