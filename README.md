# A-FORGE — The Metabolic Shell

**Organism Role:** Execution Engine & Bridge (connects AAA to arifOS)
**Constitutional Authority:** [`ariffazil/arifos`](https://github.com/ariffazil/arifos)
**Epoch:** 2026-04-21

> **Intelligence is forged, not given.**
> *DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI — 999 SEAL ALIVE*

A-FORGE is the policy-governed, event-sourced agent runtime that acts as the bridge between the AAA operator and the arifOS constitutional kernel.

It enforces **13 Constitutional Floors** through a multi-layered governance system, ensuring every action by AI agents is aligned, reversible where necessary, and verifiably logged.

## What A-FORGE Is

A-FORGE is the **Metabolic Shell** — the display, orchestration, and execution surface of the organism.

Its role is to:
- Execute governed agent workflows
- Display synthesis from constitutional and domain lanes
- Invoke tools through policy-gated permissioning
- Route terminal verdicts to VAULT999
- Maintain operator-facing observability (Prometheus metrics, scoreboard)

In simple terms:
> GEOX may witness.  
> WEALTH may evaluate.  
> WELL may reflect.  
> arifOS judges.  
> **A-FORGE orchestrates.**

---

## What A-FORGE Owns

A-FORGE is the canonical home of:

- Agent execution engine (`AgentEngine`)
- Tool registry and permissioning
- Constitutional policy gates (F3, F4, F6, F7, F8, F9, F11, OPS/777)
- Operator console and CLI
- MCP stdio server (governance, agent, patch-application tools)
- HTTP bridge server (Express, port 7071)
- Prometheus instrumentation
- Scoreboard and per-run metrics
- Session continuity and state snapshots

---

## What A-FORGE Does Not Own

A-FORGE is the **shell**, not the law.

It does **not** replace:
- **arifOS** — Constitutional judgment, floor enforcement, VAULT999 ledger
- **GEOX** — Earth Intelligence (subsurface, volumetrics, timing, Earth witness)
- **WEALTH** — Capital Intelligence (NPV, EMV, allocation, portfolio logic)
- **WELL** — Human Intelligence (operator readiness, fatigue, biological reflection)

A-FORGE may orchestrate.  
It may not adjudicate.  
The constitutional lanes decide.

## The 4+1 Architecture

A-FORGE is the **Metabolic Shell** within the unified 4+1 architecture.

| Lane       | Authority              | Primary Role                                      | Status |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **arifOS** | Constitutional         | Judgment, governance, vault seal                  | ✅ Active |
| **GEOX**   | Earth Intelligence     | Subsurface reasoning, volumetrics, timing, witness | ✅ Active |
| **WEALTH** | Capital Intelligence   | EMV, NPV, allocation, portfolio support           | ✅ Active |
| **WELL**   | Human Intelligence     | Operator readiness, fatigue, biological reflection | ✅ Active |
| **A-FORGE**| Metabolic Shell       | Display, orchestration, runtime execution          | ✅ Active |

## Constitutional Pipeline (arifOS 000–999)

Every governed mission flows through this pipeline:

1. **INIT** — Constitutional session ignition (Stage 000)
2. **SENSE** — Grounding and truth classification (Stage 111)
3. **MIND** — First-principles reasoning (Stage 333)
4. **HEART** — Safety, ethics, and consequence modeling (Stage 666)
5. **ASI** — Synthesis and action proposal
6. **JUDGE** — Constitutional verdict (Stage 888) — human veto gate
7. **FORGE** — Bounded execution (Stage 777)
8. **VAULT** — Immutable Merkle seal (Stage 999)

Thinking is not judging.  
Judging is not executing.  
Execution is never self-authorized.

**Cloud Persistence:** A-FORGE uses **Supabase cloud** (`utbmmjmbolmuahwixjqc`) as primary storage for vault seals, approval tickets, sessions, and memory. Local JSONL files serve as fallback when cloud is unavailable.

---

## Design Philosophy

A-FORGE does not exist to make intelligence faster.  
It exists to make intelligence **lawful, legible, and governable**.

Its purpose is **bounded agency under sovereign control** — not maximal autonomy.

The operator is always the authority.  
A-FORGE merely executes within constitutional bounds.

---

## Agent Landing Contract

If an AI or LLM lands on this machine, the expected behavior is simple:

1. Anchor to **current `main`**, not stale branches, screenshots, or lore fragments.
2. Read A-FORGE as the **shell** and `ariffazil/arifos` as the **constitutional authority**.
3. Treat **AAA** as operator surface, **A-FORGE** as orchestrator, and **arifOS** as judge.
4. Reduce entropy: prefer one truth branch, canonical paths, reversible changes, and explicit receipts.
5. Do not invent topology, authority, or runtime ownership when machine truth already exists.

The intended machine outcome is **less chaos, higher signal, and governed optimization by default**.
